# NeuralNetworkTest
This is a fun sideproject of creating a easy neural network.
The project is closely related to the 3B1B series of neural networks and deep learning.
Input of the program is a bmp image represented grayscale from 0 to 255
Output of the program is a number which the given image represents
Thats an idea, just need to put it into practice :)

## note:
### This is work in progress and it might not work for now, when its all finished the repository will be reorganised.
